  --- Watch the simiulation and see real time log 
  --- see log at the top of the screen
  
Parameters : 
  
  --- x0 , y0 , vx0 , vy0, ax0 , ay0 (Usually will be -9.8 for earth gravity)
   
Notice :

  --- (+) direction is directed to the top of the screen (E.x : -9.8 will be the g const of earth gravity)
